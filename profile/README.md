1.  **Join our Community on Discord**: This is where we chat, ask questions, and share ideas. [**Click here to join!**](YOUR_DISCORD_INVITE_LINK)
2.  **Introduce Yourself**: Say hello in the `#introductions` channel. Let us know what you're interested in learning!
3.  **Find Your First Contribution**: Look for issues tagged `good-first-issue` across our repositories. They're a great way to start.

## Why Join Us?

-   **Learn and Grow**: Gain real world experience working on actual projects. Learn modern tech stacks and best practices like testing and CI/CD.
-   **Build Your Portfolio**: Contribute to meaningful projects you can showcase to future employers.
-   **Find Mentorship**: Get guidance from more experienced developers in the community.
-   **Make an Impact**: Focus on building tools and applications for the greater good.

## Our Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of experience level, gender, race, or background. All members are required to agree to and follow our [**Code of Conduct**](link-to-your-CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read it to understand our community standards.

## What We Build

Our projects are community driven and aim to solve real world problems, including:

-   **Educational Tools**: Apps and platforms that make learning more accessible.
-   **Utilities for Non-Profits**: Software that helps charitable organizations achieve their goals.
-   **Developer Productivity Tools**: Open source utilities that help other developers work more efficiently.

## Our Technology Stack

We use a variety of modern technologies, giving you a chance to learn in-demand skills. While each project is different, here are some of the tools we love:

-   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vue.js, Svelte, Tailwind CSS
-   **Backend**: Go (Golang), Python, Node.js, Rust
-   **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
-   **DevOps & Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, Terraform

## How to Contribute

1.  **Find an Issue**: Look for an issue that interests you, especially those with the `good-first-issue` label.
2.  **Say Hello!**: Leave a comment on the issue to let us know you're interested.
3.  **Fork & Branch**: Create a copy ("fork") of the repository and create a new branch for your changes.
4.  **Write Your Code**: Make your changes and test them. Don't worry about perfection; we're here to help.
5.  **Open a Pull Request**: Submit a PR with a clear description of what you've done.
6.  **Collaborate & Merge**: We'll review your code together, offer friendly feedback, and merge it. Congratulations!

<details>
<summary><strong>Contribution Best Practices (Click to learn more!)</strong></summary>

-   **Branch Naming**: Name your branches descriptively, like `feature/add-user-login`.
-   **Commit Messages**: We recommend [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). *Example:* `feat(auth): add OAuth2 refresh token support`
-   **Testing**: If possible, add or update tests for the code you write.

## Project Roadmap & Proposing Ideas

We maintain a public roadmap and welcome new ideas in our central `palt-tech/community` repository.

-   **See what's next**: [View our Project Board](link-to-your-project-board).
-   **Propose an idea**: [Open a new "Idea" issue](link-to-your-issue-template-for-ideas).

## Our Engineering Culture & Guiding Principles

We strive to follow professional software development practices. This provides a great learning experience for everyone.

<details>
<summary><strong>Repository Naming and Organization</strong></summary>

-   We use clear, descriptive repository names with prefixes:
    -   `service-<name>` for deployable services
    -   `lib-<name>` for libraries/SDKs
    -   `infra-<name>` for infrastructure-as-code
    -   `docs-<name>` for documentation sets
    -   `tooling-<name>` for CLI and developer tools
-   We use repository topics to tag purpose and stack (e.g., `go`, `python`, `kubernetes`, `cli`) for easier discovery.

</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Branching Strategy and Releases</strong></summary>

-   The `main` branch is always protected. All changes must be made through a pull request with code review.
-   We use short-lived feature branches that are merged into `main` after review.
-   We use Semantic Versioning (`vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) and create official releases on GitHub.

</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Code Quality, CI/CD, and Testing</strong></summary>

-   All repositories should have automated Continuous Integration (CI) configured to run tasks like:
    -   Linting and static analysis
    -   Unit and integration tests
    -   Security scanning (dependency checks)
-   A passing CI build is required before a PR can be merged.
-   Each repository's README should document how to run tests locally.

</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Security and Responsible Disclosure</strong></summary>

-   We maintain a `SECURITY.md` file in repositories that are user-facing or handle sensitive data.
-   We provide a path for responsible disclosure, such as `security@palttech.example` or GitHub's security advisories.
-   We use tools like Dependabot to keep dependencies up to date and monitor for vulnerabilities.

</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Governance, Ownership, and Licensing</strong></summary>

-   Each repository should list its maintainers in a `MAINTAINERS.md` file or via GitHub Teams.
-   We use `CODEOWNERS` to automatically request reviews from the right people.
-   Each public repository must have a `LICENSE` file (we typically use MIT or Apache 2.0).

</details>
